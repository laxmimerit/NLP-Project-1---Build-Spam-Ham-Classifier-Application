# NLP-Project-1---Build-Spam-Ham-Classifier-Application

Join me in this NLP Project series as we build a Spam or Ham Classifier App using Streamlit! Here's a quick breakdown of what you'll learn:

- 📚 NLP Introduction: Dive into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentals.
- 📊 TF-IDF: Master Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for text analysis.
- 📁 Data Handling: Learn efficient data loading and visualization techniques.
- 🤖 Model Creation: Build a powerful classifier model tailored to your data.
- 💾 Model Management: Discover how to save and load your trained model.
- 🚀 Streamlit App: Create an interactive web app for real-time classification.
